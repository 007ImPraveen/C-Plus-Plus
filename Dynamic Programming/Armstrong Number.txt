Armstrong number

An armstrong number is a number whose sum of cube of digits is equal to the original number.

Example: 153

Here,
  Sum of cube of digits= cube(1)+cube(5)+cube(3)
                       = 1+125+27
                       = 153
  This is equal to the entered number. Hence, 153 is an armstrong number.

Code:

> In our code, we have extracted each digit of the number, found its cube and stored the sum of all such cubes in a variable. This sum has been compared in the end with the original number.

> We have used a function 'pow' to find the cube of each digit. For its implementation, a header file 'Math.h' has been used.
